# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 1


## Objective

The goal to train an agent to collect yellow bananas and avoid blue bananas. Input dimension is 37 and there are 4 discrete actions. The learning is said to be complete when an average score of 13 is obtained.

## Instructions

Install dependencies and run Navigation.ipynb file from terminal. deep_agent script contains agent code and model.py contains the neural network.
